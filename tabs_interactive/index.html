        <p class="NODE sub active">Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run
            on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript
            code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
            server-side scripting.
